#Description 

BBHO (pronounced BeeBo because names are much more fun) is a Black Box Optimization program that uses [Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf) to optimize a given unknown (black box) function. It does this using something known as Gaussian Processes for Regression, and then what is known as an acquisition function. To get an entire overarching and fundamental understanding of this method, 

####[I've made a series on my blog detailing it.](https://dark-element.com/2016/10/10/bayesian-optimization-of-black-box-functions/)

Otherwise, good luck, have fun!
